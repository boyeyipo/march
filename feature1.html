adding a brach from main called feature 1

this branch acts as working station and once all desired changes has been made the branc will be added to the main branc

command for creating branch is 

branch feature1

that add the branch feature1



then to make sure how many branches you have list them

branch -a

and to go the branch 

branch checkout feature1, the branch will contain everything as in the main.



to confirm ls to list everything in the branch


to go back to main just git checkout main.
